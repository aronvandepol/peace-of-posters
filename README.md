# Posters

[Posters](https://github.com/jonaspleyer/posters) is a Typst package to help creating scientific posters.
It is flexible and can be used for different sizes and layouts.
To see what is possible look at some real-world [examples](https://github.com/jonaspleyer/posters/examples)
of posters that I did.

## Documentation
The external [documentation](https://jonaspleyer.github.io/typst-posters/) is coming along slowly.
Most notably, there are examples and showcases missing but I hope to be adding them over the coming months.
