# science-posters

[science-posters](https://github.com/jonaspleyer/science-posters) is a Typst package to help creating scientific posters.
It is flexible and can be used for different sizes and layouts.
To see what is possible have a look at some of my own real-world examples in the [showcase](https://jonaspleyer.github.io/science-posters/showcase/) section of the documentation.

## Documentation
The external [documentation](https://jonaspleyer.github.io/science-posters/) is coming along slowly.
Most notably, there are examples and showcases missing but I hope to be adding them over the coming months.
